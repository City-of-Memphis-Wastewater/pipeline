Title: sanitizer.py
Author: Clayton Bennett
Created: 2025 05-May 17th

Purpose:
I like it when data gathered is data returned. Sanitization should not happen during import. If not entirely probitive, the entirety of the raw should be available for unforeseen use cases.
So. We need explicit and discernible sanitization scenarios, called a scripted approach, following the preparation, collection, and aggregation, insert buzz words here, etc.
