            Not the worst idea:
            Use nested structures
            Instead of flattening all column keys into the same dict, keep fetched data as a sub-dictionary.
            In which case, the aggregate should be JSON (or TOML, whatever), not CSV.
            However, we have something that works. It is fine for now.
